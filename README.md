Hi there 👋

Am Dan Covic, Am currently working for IBM as a **ServiceNow admin / developer**. Sometimes I'm asked to build all sorts of customazations 
(i.e. catalog items, new configuration items...) for all sorts of product suits (ITSM, CSM, HR...) for a variety of clients.
So, there is a lot of scripting involved - mainly JavaScript scripting.

- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of activities and learning paths. I like sports (mainly soccer and gym), I like reading (Tolstoy is my favourite writer), but I also like to learn new things, especially new technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux, Python, Machine Learning and Cybersecurity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of open source projects and ideas that inspire me.
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter or LinkedIn

Let's connect and work together on some awesome projects 😎
